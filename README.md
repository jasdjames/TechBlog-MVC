## Description

This application should create wordpress style tech blog. Unfortunately, due technical issues, time, and being confused by one particular route. I was unable to complete the application. The application does allow the user to login, logout, signup, and create a blog which is saved to the database. The blog is not posted to the dashboard or 'allBlogs' page as I would like.
